A test robot for learning.
## Building
Use the [WPILib VsCode](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) as the code editor for easy setup.
- Connect to the robot using Radio or directly using a USB cable
- Deploy the code to the robot by pressing ``ctrl+shift+p`` and use the "WPILib: Deploy Robot Code" option.
- Run the FRC Driver Station to get information of the connected bot. You can also run the robot in appropriate mode. See [this](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/offline-installation-preparations.html) for more information.
